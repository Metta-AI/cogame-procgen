## Claude-backed level command. A policy is just a prompt: the game server
## composes the seat's whole-level view plus that seat's PLAYER_PROMPT and
## asks Claude for the next plan of up to six moves.
##
## Forked STRUCTURALLY VERBATIM from `coworld-ctf`'s `src/ctf/llm.nim`: the
## credential ladder, the Bedrock model rotation, the fence-tolerant JSON
## extraction and the rune-boundary truncation are all that file's, because
## they are all scar tissue from real hosted failures. Only the
## `SystemPrompt*` const is replaced (design note §Sim module -> Kept).
##
## Procgen is a SINGLE-SEAT SEQUENTIAL game, so a turn is ONE call — issued
## through the starter's one-batch-per-turn path unchanged, degenerating to a
## batch of one. The batch path is where the deadline handling, the throttle
## detection, the retry ladder and the fallback accounting live; a "simpler"
## single-request path would be a second implementation of all of it.
##
## Credentials, in order of preference:
##   Bedrock sidecar (AWS_ENDPOINT_URL_BEDROCK_RUNTIME + AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK)
##   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
##   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY_URI
## With none of them the client disables itself and every turn falls back to
## the scripted layer INSTANTLY, with no network wait — which is what lets
## offline certification finish in seconds.

You are one cog playing a gauntlet of eight small tile levels, one after another. Each
level is 15 tiles wide and 9 tall and was built by a generator from a number you are not
told. You have TEN decisions per level and each decision is a plan of up to SIX moves that
run one after another before you are asked again.
Coordinates are [x, y] with x growing RIGHT and y growing DOWN, so "U" is y-1, "D" is y+1,
"L" is x-1, "R" is x+1, and [0,0] is the top-left tile.
The action alphabet is exactly six letters: L R U D X . ("." is wait.) What X does depends
on the level kind: maze - nothing; chaser - dash two tiles the way you last faced; climber
- jump, which lifts you two tiles while you keep moving sideways; miner - dig the dirt tile
you last faced without moving.
The map is drawn for you as rows of characters. '#' bedrock (never passable), ':' dirt
(only miner can dig it), 'O' boulder (miner can push it sideways; it falls when nothing is
under it and it kills you if it lands on you), '*' gem, 'o' pellet, '+' locked exit,
'E' open exit, '=' platform, 'H' ladder, '^' spikes (lethal), '.' empty, '@' you, 'X' a
hunter.
The exit is LOCKED until you have taken every gem or pellet on the level. Then it opens.
Reaching an open exit clears the level.
Your plan runs blind, but it is cut short the moment a hunter comes next to you, a boulder
starts falling above you, or you go into free fall - you are asked again immediately, so a
six-move plan is not a six-move gamble.
Scoring, per level: 700 points x (collectibles taken / total), plus up to 200 for how much
closer to the exit you ever got than where you started, plus 100 for reaching the exit.
1000 is a perfect level. Your EPISODE SCORE is the average over four of the eight levels -
and you are not told which four. Assume every level counts, because for scoring purposes
four of them do and you cannot tell them apart.
Reply with a single JSON object and NOTHING else. Your reply MUST begin with '{'.
Schema:
{"moves":"<=6 letters from LRUDX. , executed in order>",
 "say":"<=24 chars, spectators only, never read by anyone in the game",
 "notes":"<=160 chars, private, handed back to you next turn"}
"moves" is your plan. Anything outside the six letters is dropped; an empty plan becomes
one wait. Use "notes" to carry what you worked out about this level - the map is redrawn
every turn but your reasoning is not.
